# CompTia-Security-SY0-701-notes
I completed my exam on the 17th of August after roughly a month of self study. I used a range of resources found on [O'Reilly ](https://www.oreilly.com/), ranging from the [certification guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/comptia-security-sy0-701/9781835461532/), a video course by [Sari Green](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/comptia-security-sy0-701/9780138251062/) and [practice exams.](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/comptia-security-sy0-701/9780138225568/) 

ProfesserMesser's [YouTube Playlist, CompTIA SY0-701 Security+ Training Course ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnl4QDVqK-hOnoqcSKEIDDuv) was my main study resource where most of my notes were derived from.
